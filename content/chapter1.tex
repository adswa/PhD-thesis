\chapter{Improving scientific practice through software usability: The DataLad Handbook}
\label{chap:k2}

Look mom, some text!

Parts of this chapter were published as \citet{wagner2020datalad}: ``The DataLad Handbook'' and are appropriately marked as such.


\section{Background: Common deficits of scientific software and their consequences}

Although it is commonly regarded as separate from the actual piece of software, software documentation is heavily tied to the quality of a software tool.
\citet{Parnas2011} describes a vicious circle that sets in when the quality of software documentation is poor:

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Reduced [documentation] quality leads to reduced [software] usage.
\item Reduced [software] usage leads to reductions in both resources and motivation.
\item Reduced resources and motivation degrade [software] quality further
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}
