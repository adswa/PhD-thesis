\chapter{Ensuring computational reproducibility across computational environments}
\label{chap:k3}

% from NISO: Beyond their potential to mitigate transparency and reproducibility issues, these practices provide important benefits for individual researchers by increasing exposure, reputation, chances of publication, number of citations, media attention, potential collaborations, and position and funding opportunities (Allen and Mehler, 2019; McKiernan et al., 2016; Nosek et al., 2022; Markowetz, 2015; Hunt, 2019).
Partially fueled by external incentives or requirements \citep{mckiernan2016open, dfg}, research curricula founded within the Open Science Movement \citep{munafo2017manifesto, poldrack2017scanning}, and a growing ecosystem of openly available infrastructure and tools \citep{NISO2022119623}, practices of publishing reproducibly are becoming more frequent.
Widespread sharing of code and data allows researchers to verify, reuse, and improve upon past work \citep{borghi2018data}.
Grass-roots movements such as Reprohack (\href{https://www.reprohack.org/}{www.reprohack.org}) or the ``Ten Years Reproducibility Challenge'' (\href{https://rescience.github.io/ten-years/}{rescience.github.io/ten-years}) train researchers to check published studies for reproducibility.
Consequently, attempts to reproduce previous studies often happen in different computational environments than those that originally created the results in question.
Ensuring computational reproducibility across computational environments is, however, a difficult technical challenge.
This following chapter outlines first its challenges, particularly in the field of neuroimaging, then its opportunities, and lastly an implementation to ensure computational reproducibility across computational environments.

\section{The origins of reproducibility}

% from NISO: psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Klein et al., 2018), social sciences (Camerer et al., 2016, 2018), neuroimaging (Munafò et al., 2017; Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021), preclinical cancer biology research (Errington et al., 2021; Errington et al., 2021), and more (Hutson, 2018; Nissen et al., 2016; Serra-Garcia and Gneezy, 2021).
Over the past decade, interest in reproducibility has been fueled by salient failures to reconfirm published results -- often termed \textit{reproducibility crises} -- in numerous fields \citep{baker20161}, from psychology \citep{open2015estimating}, to biomedical imaging \citep{wagner202310}, to artificial intelligence \citep{hutson2018artificial}, or econonmics \citep{camerer2016evaluating}.
However, proposals to increase reproducibility, transparency, and robustness of science were made independently in various disciplines long before the current trend, in some cases dating back several centuries \citep[such as Boyle (1666), as cited in][]{RobertBoylesDesigneaboutNaturalHistory}.
Even the field of \textit{computational reproducibility} originated already more than 30 years ago in the field of seismology \citep{claerbout1992electronic, buckheit1995wavelab}, despite increased usage of the term in scientific literature only from 2015 onward (see \cref{fig:ngram}).
Consequently, the terminology around reproducibility has varied considerably over the years and across domains, and there is no universally agreed upon standardization of terminology in place yet \citep{barba2018terminologies}.
To disambiguate between several conflicting definitions of terms around reproducibility that are in active use, we shall define the terms used in this thesis as follows:

\subsubsection{Reproducibility}

Following the definition of \citet{peng2006}, \textit{reproducibility} refers to the practice of verifying a published result with the same methods and materials used by the original authors.

\subsubsection{Replicability}

\textit{Replicability}, on the other hand, refers to strengthening scientific evidence when several independent researchers find similar results using ``independent data, analytical methods, laboratories, and instruments'' \citep{peng2006}.

\subsubsection{Computational Reproducibility}

\textit{Computational reproducibility}, finally, matches the definition put forward in the 2019 report on ``Reproducibility and Replicability in Science'' by the \citet{engineering2019reproducibility}: ``We define reproducibility to mean computational reproducibility – obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis''.

\subsection{``Everything matters'' for computational reproducibility in neuroimaging}

% maybe NARPS paper?`

As this definition of computational reproducibility implies, the building blocks of research output extend to more than the files that constitute the actual research output, but also to all elements involved in its generation \citep{claerbout1992electronic}.
Consider different types of research output:
Raw data originates from acquisitions based on - potentially ongoing - experiments, raw data transformations, or data cleaning.
Processed data or results stem from computations with analysis code or software in specific versions on particular data.
And software, expressed in raw (code) or derived (transformed into executable) form, is created or used in specific computational environments, with compilers, underlying libraries, and systems in distinct versions.
Consequently, these building blocks play an integral part in the genesis of research outputs, and changes in these building blocks or their composition can translate to changes in the resulting research output.\\
Because of their complexity, neuroimaging studies face obstacles for reproducibility.
For one, the details of how code, software, or data have been used to generate a research output, such as analysis parameterization, the subset of data used as input, or sequence and invocation of employed software tools, are volatile.
Shared code and data does not always suffice to reproduce a result:
A study of data availability, reusability, and reproducibility demonstrated that well-described, ``in principle reusable'' data often does not suffice to reproduce the scientific findings of the corresponding publications due to  missing process provenance metadata \citep{hardwicke2018data}.
Secondly, even if methods and their sequence are well-described, precise information about the employed software tools is crucial, too.
The fact that different neuroimaging analysis software can produce distinct results from the same data despite using similar conceptual methodology is well known \citep{bowring2019exploring}.
This has been attributed to implementation differences \citep{palumbo2019evaluation}, software errors \citep{eklund2016cluster}, or analytic configurations \citep{pauli2016exploring}.
For example, in task-based fMRI, \citet{li2021moving} found that the choice of output space or resolution can have a marked impact on variability between conceptually similar processing pipelines.
Moreover, even with identical pipelines and data, surprising result variability can occur with minor variations in parametrization.
\citet{mueller2017commentary} reported that the choice of resampling resolution impacts alpha inflation, and \citet{li2021moving} identified the decision whether or not to include global signal regression as a major source of intra-pipeline variation.
Finally, even the same analysis, with identical parametrization, software tool, and data, can result in different outcomes if it is repeated across different operating systems, or with differences in versions of a singular software tool or operating system \citep{gronenschild2012effects, glatard2015reproducibility}.
%more here
Computational reproducibility across computing environments thus often remains elusive unless accounted for from the very start.
Therefore, in addition to ``Everything matters'',  \citet{kennedy2019everything} cued the phrase ``Reproducible by Design (as opposed to reproducibility as an afterthought)'' for conducting research in a way that makes computational reproducibility possible.
The next section highlights a number of strategies for this.

% However, a growing number of studies suggest that differences in the implementation of these processing steps or how they are “glued together” can yield notably different outcomes. Studies systematically comparing specific preprocessing steps such as segmentation15, motion correction16, and registration17–19 have reported substantial variation in outputs generated across independently developed packages when applied to the same data. In the analysis of task fMRI data, end-to-end pipelines built using different software packages have been found to produce marked variation in the final results20–23. from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.01.470790v2.full


\section{Towards re-usable research objects}


The reusability of research objects has become a distinct characteristic of scientific practice as it allows for reproduction, verification, building up upon and extending existing work, evidence synthesis, and minimizing duplicate efforts in the advancement of science \citep{thanos2017research}.
With this, it maximizes the impact of the funding and work that resulted in the research output.
Its central role in the \gls{FAIR} principles \citep{wilkinson2016fair} and a variety of funding sources such as the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC, UK), the European Research Council (ERC, EU), or the National Institutes of Health (NIH, US) are a testament to this.
In the scope of the FAIR principles, reusability focuses on the ability of a human or a machine to decide if data are useful and usable in a particular context.
This reusability requires trust \citep{bechhofer2013linked}: Re-users must be able to audit the steps performed in an experiment or analysis in order to be convinced of the validity of the results or derivatives.
FAIR principle R1.2, ``(Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance'' \citep{wilkinson2016fair}, refers to this.
This principle also encodes the process provenance necessary for reproducibility.
And indeed, reproducibility and trust are closely related:
Where resources are not fully FAIR yet, manual reproducibility typically yields the trust that process provenance would otherwise provide.
A new project, for example, commonly starts with a check if the previous foundational findings still hold.\\
As the FAIR principles advocate for richly curated metadata, many scientific fields or projects argue in favor of coordinated use of ontologies for metadata and brought forward efforts for ontology development and consensus building \citep[e.g.,][]{wise2019implementation, abrams2022standards, papadiamantis2020metadata}.
But not in all domains are the necessary metadata standards incentivized or ready to use.
A few years before the publication of the FAIR principles, \citet{bechhofer2010research} cued the term ``reusable research object'' in a conceptual position paper.
They describe it as a precursor of a FAIR research object, specifically as a ``container for a principled aggregation of resources, produced and consumed by common services and shareable within and across organisational boundaries [...that] includes not only the data used, and methods employed to produce and analyse that data, but also the people involved in the investigation. An association with a dataset (or service, or result collection, or instrument) is now more than just a citation or reference to that dataset (or service or result collection). The association is rather a link to that dataset (or service or result collection) that can be explicitly followed or dereferenced providing access to the actual resource and thus enactment of the service, query or retrieval of data, and so on.''  \citep{bechhofer2010research}
This description matches characteristics that DataLad datasets or its contents can posses.
% Detail how datalad adheres to these requirements.
In the following, I will highlight four properties of research objects that can arise from pragmatic research data management -- versioned, actionable, modular, and portable -- and how these properties make them reusable  even if full FAIRness can not yet be achieved \citep{wagnerohbm2021}.
% and argue why the \gls{rdm} features that DataLad provides assist with FAIRification.

\subsubsection{Exhaustive versioning}

The information ``I generated X from data Y with software Z'' is insufficient for reproducibility and trustworthiness if Y exists in multiple versions or subsets, if different releases of Z have relevant implementation differences, or if Z behaves differently depending on the environment it is used in.
If digital research objects are exhaustively tracked, they can be accessed and used transparently in a uniquely identified version state.
This exhaustive identity registration removes ambiguity that arises if the files in question are not completely static.
Therefore, the first relevant feature that DataLad provides for reproducibility and reusability is version control for all relevant files -- from data to code to software environments.
In addition, this makes the DataLad dataset a suitable overlay structure to encompass every relevant element for a scientific project, laying the foundation to include all digital data, methods, and provenance as a reusable research object as \citet{bechhofer2010research} propose.
% make point about **exhaustive** tracking stronger

\subsubsection{Actionable metadata}

Process provenance metadata how a file came to be is often incomplete and difficult to retrace \citep{hardwicke2018data}.
As it is tedious, often without an immediate benefit for curators, and rarely explicitly incentivized to retrospectively annotate research objects with process provenance \citep{edwards2011science, san2009long}, this information should be captured at the time of creation, with the tools and persons that are involved in the creation of research outputs anyway \citep{dallas2016digital}.
But while early curation can increase the comprehensiveness of metadata, additional measures should guarantee its validity, as even fully described research outputs fail to be reproducible or reusable if their description or provenance contains errors \citep[see, e.g.,][]{manninen2017reproducibility}.
The most pragmatic approach to validate metadata is to base subsequent processing on them.
For a simple example, consider a codified parametrization of an analysis in a configuration or analysis design file  \citep[see, e.g.,][]{jas2018reproducible}:
If an analysis based on it completes successfully, it constitutes valid provenance metadata, created by an expert or automatically at the earliest possible time at no additional cost, and adds immediate benefit for curators as it captures relevant provenance and detects erroneous or missing metadata in passing.
Creation and validation is easiest if it is an automatic process within the research process, and if the tools used during the creation also use the same metadata that gets eventually published alongside the final research output.
Therefore, the actionable metadata DataLad can acquire from command executions are the second relevant property for reusability.
Even if this metadata does not follow established community standards as required by the \gls{FAIR} principles yet, it preserves knowledge that would otherwise be lost, without requiring additional training, impeding later additions, or putting additional burden on scientists - it is a byproduct of standard scientific practice.
The fact that it can be re-executed automatically, and that resulting recomputations are automatically compared to previous versions by employed version control tools, provides an effortless form of validation.


\subsubsection{Modular structure}

The reusability of scientific work can improve if it is accessible in modular units that constitute unambiguous multi-use components, such as raw data, processed data, or software.
In the simplest case, modularization means placing conceptually distinct content into separate files, and grouping files in individual directories to reflect more global structures.
Distinct units, such as the directories ``code/'' and ``inputs/'', increase transparency if each location is associated with distinguishable content, ease flexible recombination of such components into new projects, allow continuous evolution of an individual module without impact on other components of a project, and enable location-specific access control.
Though a single modular unit can not entail all relevant elements of a scientific study or data analysis, exhaustive tracking of all elements without sacrificing modularity can be achieved by linking multiple modular units in dependency relationships.
A useful metaphor are package management systems such as conda (\url{https://docs.conda.io}) or APT (\url{https://wiki.debian.org/Apt}): A software package is a modular unit, installed with a package manager.
However, packages usually depend on other software packages, which are listed as its ``dependencies''.
During installation, package managers check if all of the linked dependencies exist on the system, and if not, install them in the required versions automatically.
Thus, a third feature for reusability is modularity as provided with DataLad's subdataset mechanism.
In scientific projects, modular units (data, software, code) are the dependencies of a given research output.
When those units are tracked as datasets, dependency relationships in the form of subdatasets form actionable links with precise versions.
This mirrors the linked dependencies that \citet{bechhofer2010research} proposed.


\subsubsection{Portability}

The fourth property is portability.
The more portable a digital research object is, the easier it is to reuse it.
A research object is fully portable if no adjustments are necessary for it to function the way it is intended to on different computational infrastructure -- ideally even when used by a naive re-user with a different area of expertise (i.e., without domain knowledge).
The more adjustment or domain knowledge is necessary, the less portable a research output becomes.
A factor contributing to portability self-containment such that research outputs can be used or reproduced on different computational infrastructure by other users.
Completeness is crucial for this, and a research output should be accompanied by the necessary code, data, and computational environment to produce it.
Self-containment also entails that a project can be moved across computers and remains functional without adjustment, for example by ensuring that no references to file system, operating system, or user specific idiosyncrasies are included.
Only if a re-user does not need to modify project files, they can be certain that they did not inadvertently break or influence the output with it.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{vamp.png}
	\caption[DataLad datasets as reusable research objects]{Reusing research outputs implies trust, and trust should be earned through verification. Verification is enabled by provenance information. Provenance capture of research outcomes requires exhaustive tracking of all inputs, as well as process records that describe how inputs were combined and transformed to generate outputs (middle). When lightweight metadata are actionable, they can be used to reproduce research outputs in a different environment from precisely identified inputs by (re-)applying the recorded process (left). A data structure that affords this type of portable recomputation is a self-contained unit that can be reused as a modular input component for incremental research (right).

% curation needs to be pragmatic

Although FAIR research objects are universally desirable, in practice, the necessary standards and procedures for creating FAIR (meta)data are not always already in place when research is conducted.
This can turn FAIRification into a bureaucratic data governance effort, diminishing the immediately obvious benefits for the curator \citep{zehl2016handling}.
However, the four properties outlined above are a big step into the right direction, and essentially a byproduct from pragmatic research data management in DataLad datasets.
\cref{fig:vamp} illustrates how it yields trusted and reusable research objects, and the next section details a technical implementation and proof-of-concept analysis to create such reusable research objects as a byproduct of \gls{rdm} in analyses of any scale.

\section{FAIRly big: A framework for computationally reproducible processing of large-scale data}

Large-scale datasets pose additional challenges for \gls{FAIR} research objects.
Their storage and computational demands increasingly exceed common \gls{HPC} infrastructure, and computing procedures that are common in fields accustomed to smaller datasets (such as storing multiple copies of the data) become infeasible with these datasets \citep{horien2021hitchhiker}.
As the complexity of reproducing and verifying large scale datasets growths, the trustworthiness of derivative data decreases.
And as data processing results often multiply storage demands, keeping intermediate outcomes on disk is rendered increasingly prohibitive, further impeding the possibility to retrace and verify the origin and provenance of research outcomes fully and transparently.
Yet for large scale datasets specifically, sharing data derivatives is the most -- or sometimes the only -- viable way to extend previous research \citep{craddock2013neuro}:
Resource-heavy, costly computations with considerable environmental impact \citep{portegies2020ecological} have to be computed only once, and scholars without access to adequate computational resources for original analysis can reuse derivatives.


Based on DataLad, containerization software, and job scheduling systems, we build a a portable, free and open source framework to reproducibly process large-scale datasets.
It empowers reusers to automatically reproduce results based on machine-actionable records of computational provenance, in an infrastructure-agnostic fashion.
The framework capitalizes on established technology, used in conjunction with workflows from software development and workload management.
In a proof-of-concept analysis, we applied the framework to run a MATLAB-based, containerized, neuroimaging processing pipeline on data from the UKB project \citep[][comprising 76 TB in 43 million files under strict usage constraints]{matthews2015uk}.

The proposed framework employs a range of software tools for data, code, and computation management to apply workflows from software engineering — in particular distributed development — to computational research. Specifically, it orchestrates arbitrary data processing via a lean network of interconnected, but self-sufficient workspaces while optimizing for portability, scalability, and automatic computational reproducibility.

To achieve this, our framework combines a range of open source software tools — distributed version control systems, containerization software, job scheduling tools, and storage solutions with optional encryption and compression — into a sequential workflow. A complete, schematic overview is depicted in Figure 1 and basic DataLad concepts are summarized in Box 1. Three key features of this data management solution are central to the framework:

Comprehensive data structure to track all elements of digital processing

Computation in automatically bootstrapped ephemeral workspaces

Process provenance capture in machine-actionable records



% role of sample size for reproducible results: \citep{li2021moving}

%  \citep{li2021moving} "highlight the reality that as the test-retest reliability approaches optimal levels for laboratory measurement, pipeline implementation differences will impose an inherent upper bound on the agreement of preprocessed data. These findings also underscore that 10 minutes of data, which has been common in the field until at least recent years, are insufficient for producing results that are reliable enough to reveal substantive pipeline-related variation."

Depicted files are from the UK Biobank showcase. b) Process-flowchart: First, a DataLad dataset links required processing components (e.g., input data, processing pipeline, additional scripts). Next, compute jobs are executed, if possible in parallel. Afterwards, results and provenance are aggregated (merged). c) An ephemeral (short-lived) compute workspace: Each compute job creates a temporary, lean clone, which retrieves only relevant subsets of data, and captures the processing execution as provenance. After completion, results and provenance are pushed into permanent storage (see d), and the ephemeral workspace is purged. d) The internal dataset representation in a RIA store: The store receives results and can contain input data, optionally using compressed archives (for reduced disk space/inode consumption) or encryption during storage and transport. It is the only place where results take up permanent disk space. If inputs are available from other infrastructure (external, web-accessible servers, cloud infrastructure), jobs can obtain them from registered sources, removing the need for duplicate storage of input data.}

The genesis of an analysis output (Analysis A/B) based on intermediate processing outcomes (Tailored results A/B) can thus be traced back all the way to the original raw data. Access control and storage choices are independent across individual components in this network of linked data modules. Aggregated data and analysis results can be shared with larger audiences or publicly on a variety of platforms, while raw and derived data may underlie particular access restrictions, or require particular hosting solutions due to their size.}

The provenance is stored as a structured, JSON-formatted record linked to a Git commit. b) To re-execute a process, the datalad rerun command only needs to be parameterized with a revision identifier, such as a Git tag, a “commit shasum” (e035f896s45c9fa[...] in this example), or a revision range containing one or more commits with associated provenance records. c) The datalad containers-run call is at the center of each individual job. As the core execution command (see Listing 1, line 33-39), it performs data retrieval, container execution, and result capture, and generates the actionable provenance that a subsequent datalad rerun command (b) can re-execute. With complete provenance, a re-execution is supported on the original hardware, or on different infrastructure. d) The machine-readable, re-executable provenance record stored alongside computed results in the revision history.

One way to track digital files is
While it is possible to exhaustively track all elements involved in a project with version control, industry use differs from RDM demands in science.
In industry contexts, it is primarily employed in software engineering for small-sized text files (source code). Science often works with large amounts of potentially sizable or binary files.
To exhaustively track all elements involved in a scientific project, large and binary files such as data and computational environments need to be versioned, too.
The concept of software containers - portable, light-weight software environments - make it possible to encapsulate computational environments as in-principle trackable elements, and a range of tools provide the ability to track even terabyte-sized and binary files.
Overall, version control is a well-established and reliable tool in industry and science. It can be employed at any point during a project, and yields a hands-on digital notebook of a project.
By extending its use beyond small-sized files to any digital research outputs and everything involved in its generation, version control can not only constitute established and beneficial research data management, but also lay the foundation for reusability by exhaustively tracking relevant digital elements and making them identifiable in precise versions.

From Donoho Buckheit 2015: Performance has everything to do with specifics: exactly what was done (which wavelets,
which coders, which detectors, which corpus of data) with exactly what parameters. In
this setting, publishing figures or results without the complete software environment could
be compared to a mathematician publishing an announcement of a mathematical theorem
without giving the proof. Waveleticians ought to publish their complete computational
environments


As highlighted in the Introduction, digital research outputs are the by- or end-products of scientific studies or analyses, from code, software, raw data or processed data, to analysis results or papers.
