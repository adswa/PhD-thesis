\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:k1}

Outline: The main goal is to make a contribution to the topic of brain states.
To this end, we used a pre-existing dataset.
This posed a challenge in several aspects.
The dataset has been processed extensively already, but the acquisition and processing had been done by people who left the lab.
Existing analyses were mostly left in an interim state, in an idiosyncratic organization, and as a single bulk of scripts and results.
Details about the acquisition and participants had to be inferred after the fact, from interviewing involved people, an acquisition site at a different institution, or the vast amount of documents left behind.

A different challenge was the processing setup.
The data was acquired and partially analyzed on infrastructure of the University of Magdeburg.
Storage and further analyses were done on the computational cluster of the HHU.
My own analyses were done in the research center JÃ¼lich.
However, an explicit aim of all processing was portability, such that research outcomes yielded on FZJ infrastructure were readily usable on HHU servers.

These challenges are not uncommon in scientific endeavours.
Over several decades already, data shared across institutions or even openly has been a corner stone of neuroscientific progress, and this trend is increasing (CITE).
It is further common to reuse finished or intermediate outcomes of previous projects in new analyses.
However, this makes research data management a fundamental prerequisite.
This thesis summarizes my conjunct work on research data management solutions and their applications in an analyses project on \gls{meg} data.

\section{Research data management}
%This is an introduction on the importance of research data management for reproducible science

Research data encompasses everything that is produced in the life span of a research project.
From raw data acquisitions, preprocessed or otherwise standardized datasets, to software, analysis scripts, results, figures, compiled reports, and other final or intermediate research outcomes.
To disambiguate the term ``research data'' from the smaller-scoped meaning of ``data'' in colloquial language (the outcome of a data acquisition in an experiment), it is also referred to as ``research objects``, and, in case it exists in purely electronic form, as ``digital research objects'' \citep{bechhofer2010research}. \\
Typically, research objects have a much longer life span than the project that creates them.
Science is an incremental process that produces and builds up on more than just published journal articles \citep{mons2018data}, and code, data, results, or tools of previous finished or unfinished projects fuel new undertakings.
\gls{rdm} describes the handling of these research objects through their entire life cycle: from curation, use, publication and sharing, archiving to re-use or destruction (\cref{fig:rdm-lifecycle}).
Ultimately, it ensures that research objects are preserved to act as an evidence base for findings, and as a discoverable resource for further reuse.
As I will lay out in this section and in upcoming chapters, \gls{rdm} is a foundational element within good scientific practice, and an important prerequisite for computational neuroscience.

\subsection{The FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship}

Since their publication, the so-called \glsunset{FAIR}\gls{FAIR} principles \citep{wilkinson2016fair} have become guidelines for \gls{rdm} efforts for digital research objects.
They describe four measurable properties of research data that -- the better they are fulfilled -- serve the ultimate goal to improve the discoverability and reusability of data by machines and humans alike \citep{wilkinson2016fair}.
The \gls{FAIR}ness of data can be improved on each of the four related but separable major characteristics that are behind the \gls{FAIR} acronym (taken verbatim from \citet{wilkinson2016fair}):

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{F}indable: To be Findable, (meta)data  are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier (F1); data are described with rich metadata (F2); metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes (F3);  (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource (F4)
	\item \textbf{A}ccessible: To be Accessible, (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol (A1); the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable (A1.1); the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary (A1.2);  metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available (A2)
	\item \textbf{I}nteroperable:  To be Interoperable, (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation (I1); (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles (I2); (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data (I3); and
	\item \textbf{R}eusable: To be Reusable, meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes (R1); (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license (R1.1); (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance (R1.2); (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards (R1.3)
\end{itemize}

A pivotal factor for the importance of the FAIR principles is the increasing digitization of research practice, and with it, a rapid growth in research data \citep{dfg}.
Innovation relies on the ability to integrate new and existing data, and where the amount of data to discover, understand, and consolidate requires automation, research objects themselves need to become self-descriptive.
For this, the term ``machine-actionable'' is central to the \gls{FAIR} principles.
It is used to describe an ideal state in which a digital object provides detailed information (metadata) to an autonomously-acting, computational data explorer in two possible contexts: For one, as metadata about the object (``What is it?''), and second, as metadata about its content (``How do I process it?'') \citep{wilkinson2016fair}.
Notably, the \gls{FAIR} principles do not suggest specific metadata standards, implementations, or technology choices.
They do highlight the importance of community-endorsed vocabularies, however, and advocate to either extend them if they do not yet include the attributes required for rich annotations, or create suitable new community-endorsed vocabularies. \\
The end state of FAIR \gls{rdm} for any digital research object is a high quality digital publication that facilitates and simplifies its discovery, evaluation, and reuse in downstream studies.
This reusability refers to the further use or utilization inside or outside its original research context, by the original author or different actors.
It is arguably the most important feature of a research object for various stakeholders: It can make research more efficient, foster collaborations, and speed up progress, and as it can reduce duplicate efforts it constitutes an economical benefit for funders as well as the public and industry \citep{nfdi2022data}.
Considering additional time spent, cost of redundant storage, licensing costs, research retraction, double funding, and missed potential for economic growth, the European Commission estimates that the cost of not having FAIR data lies between 10 and 26 billion euro per year \citep{eu2019FAIR}.
The largest position in their cost-benefit analysis is the time wasted by researchers when non-FAIR data takes more time to find, retrieve, clean, integrate, and peer review.
Together with the aspect of research retraction, the last point hints at an important side effect of good data management: Reproducibility.
Throughout this thesis, the connection between research data management and reproducibility will be exemplified.
The following sections will outline \gls{rdm} requirements and solutions in the field of neuroimaging that work towards this goal.


% Internationally accepted standard
%The largest funding institution for the sciences and humanities and research in Germany, the \gls{grf}, states that access to data and software according the the FAIR principles are of comparable importance to science as access to publications \citep{dfg}

Neuroimaging data poses a number of additional challenges for research data management.
For one, the field is characterized by complex datasets.
They typically encompass different modalities (such as imaging, electro-physiological, and behavioral measurements), and often entail several recording sessions.
The \gls{BIDS} \citep{gorgolewski2016brain} is a community-endorsed standard for organizing and describing neuroimaging data, and is widely considered as a successful solution for data standardization in such datasets.
It defines common and modality specific schemes for file names and file organization, file formats, and metadata to accompany raw  or derived data, i.e., both original acquisitions as well as the outputs of common processing pipelines.
\gls{BIDS} has widespread and growing support for different neuroimaging modalities, and is made a common prerequisite by neuroscientific data portals such as OpenNeuro \citep{markiewicz2021openneuro} or processing tools such as BIDSApps \citep{gorgolewski2017bids} or fMRIprep \citep{esteban2019fmriprep}.
An example of an \gls{meg} dataset, structured to \gls{BIDS} or organized idiosyncratically, is shown in \cref{fig:BIDS}. \\
The storage demands of neuroimaging data are not trivial, either.
\gls{BIDS} regulates which file formats must be used for which data type, and focuses on open file formats for accessibility and compression to reduce disk space requirements.
But neuroimaging data are nevertheless sizable \citep{van2014human}.
And a growing awareness that robust findings require sufficiently long recordings \citep{li2021moving} as well as large and representative samples \citep{button2013power, turner2018small} leads to large-scale datasets such as the \gls{HCP} \citep{van2013wu}, the \gls{ABCD} Study \citep{casey2018adolescent}, or the \gls{UKB} project \citep{matthews2015uk} that pose infrastructural challenges for storage, analysis, transfer and archival.
Moreover, in human neuroimaging, data underlie strict data protection regulations such as the \gls{HIPAA} in the United States, or the \gls{GDPR} in Europe.
This requires compliance to variable terms of data usage agreements, and often involves idiosyncratic processes to retrieve data \citep{waitedata}.\\
Processing of neuroimaging data is complex, too.
It usually involves multi-stepped workflows from acquisition through analysis to archival, where each step frequently requires several different software tools \citep{poline2011, NISO2022119623}.
The number of ``researchers' degrees of freedom'' -- the amount of possible combinations of methods, parameters, and tools -- in neuroimaging analyses is thus large \citep{bowring2019exploring}.
But variations in analytic choices affect numeric results and conclusions \citep{silberzahn2018}.
When \citet{botvinik2020variability} instructed 70 independent research teams to analyze the same task-based \gls{fMRI} dataset with tools and methods of their choice to test the same hypotheses, conclusions were highly variable.
A similar project, EEGManyPipelines (\href{https://eegmanypipelines.org/}{eegmanypipelines.org}), is currently ongoing in the field of \gls{eeg}, and expects to find even more variability.
One central aspect \gls{rdm} thus needs to provide in neuroimaging is precise information about how tools, data, and actors were involved in the generation of a file.
This is necessary because, despite reporting guidelines for \gls{MRI} \citep{nichols2017best}, \gls{meg} \citep{pernet2020issues}, and \gls{eeg} \citep{styles2021towards} studies, traditional publications still regularly fail to report all relevant details about recording, processing, and analysis  \citep[see, e.g.,][]{vsovskic2022better}.
Such \textit{digital provenance} (illustrated in \cref{fig:prov1}) is not meant to decrease the analytical variability.
Instead, it captures thorough, machine-actionable processing descriptions that are necessary to investigate differences between analysis outcomes, reproduce, or reuse them as \gls{FAIR} principle R2 advocates.
Chapter \ref{chap:k3} will further elaborate on this problem.\\
Overall, careful \gls{rdm} is necessary to translate complex data with difficult storage requirements and sophisticated processing workflows efficiently into scientific insights in the field of neuroimaging.
Given these specific complexities, solutions to these challenges often arise from the community of researchers.
The following section will highlight one of several software tools that aids with the complex task of research data management: DataLad.
%A subsequent chapter, \cref{chap:k2}, will later focus on how research data management is a prerequisite of reproducible research, specifically with regards to software environments and large sample sizes.
%In addition, \cref{chap:k2} will highlight pragmatic approaches to \gls{rdm} that can be embedded in standard research practice and contribute to the FAIRification of data, even in absence of established metadata formats.

%This introduces DataLad as a software solution for research data management

DataLad (\href{http://datalad.org}{datalad.org}) is a Python-based, MIT-licensed software tool for the joint management of code, data, and their relationship.
It builds up on git-annex, a versatile system for data logistics \citep{hessannex}, and Git, the industry standard for distributed version control.
To address the technical challenges of data management, data sharing, and digital provenance collection, it adapts principles of open-source software development and distribution to scientific workflows. \\
%Initially, DataLad development started with the idea to make data retrieval as easy as installing software with package managers on Unix-based operating systems\footnote{On a Debian system, a user can install thousands of software package with a single command such as \texttt{apt get install <package-name>}.}.
%Now, DataLad aims to make data management as easy as managing code \citep{Halchenko2021}.
DataLad's aim is ``to make data management as easy as managing code'' \citep{Halchenko2021}.
The latter benefits from a well-established ecosystem of tools, platforms, and processes.
The distributed version control tool Git provides the ability to track changes in small-sized, text-based files, and is a de-facto standard in collaborative software development. In 2022, 93.78\% of respondents in Stackoverflow's annual developer survey (\url{survey.stackoverflow.co}) reported to use it.
Hosting platforms for Git repositories such as GitHub (\url{github.com}), GitLab ({\url{gitlab.com}), or Gin (\url{gin.g-node.org}) have been developed to serve as facilitators for collaboration, discovery, and reuse.
In the scientific community it is widely recommended to employ version control for code to foster reproducibility \citep[e.g.,][]{sandve2013ten}, and it is established practice to develop and share research software and code using Git and Git hosting platforms \citep[e.g.,][]{nord2019towards, strupler2017reproducibility, bryan2018excuse, corti2019managing}.
But other components of scientific projects, such as data or computing environments, are not as transparently managed or accessible as code and software.
Digital research objects are usually stored in multiple different locations \citep{parsons2013research}, and their consumption is complicated by disconnected and non-interoperable hosting solutions:
Different storage services use different protocols, means of authentication, or other idiosyncrasies that require custom workflows.
Moreover, as will be elaborated in chapter \ref{chap:k3}, scientific computation is not reproducible enough, because data provenance is often incomplete and rarely automatically captured.
And over the course of a research project, often as part of the standard, multi-stepped processing workflow, data evolve and change just like code does:
Continued acquisitions enlarge the raw dataset; Transformations to -- likewise evolving -- community standards change file formats, dataset organization, or enrich available metadata; And continuous quality control processes can fix errors in datasets.
In the case that data or other research objects were subject to change over the course of a project, there is a need to identify which exact version has been used -- otherwise, the reproducibility of a result is threatened \citep{hardwicke2018data}.
Yet unlike code in software development, data tend not to be as precisely identifiable because data versioning is rarely or only coarsely practiced.
Last but not least, in the absence of standardized data packages, there is no uniform way to declare actionable
data dependencies and derivative relationships between inputs and outputs of a computation.
Consequentially, data needs to be kept alongside to results to ensure reproducibility, even if it is hosted elsewhere already.
Especially in the age of big data neuroscience \citep{bzdok2017inference}, downloads or storage of datasets can become infeasible \citep{horien2021hitchhiker, grisham2016proposed}.
And although projects might only draw insights from only a subset of a dataset, such as only specific modalities, tasks, or participants, a project has heavier disk space demands if the original dataset is only available as a bulk download.\\
DataLad aims to solve these issues by providing streamlined, transparent management of code, data, computing environments, and their relationship.
Its main features are 1) Version control for data of any size or type; 2) Streamlined procedures to consume, publish, and update  all elements of scientific projects, with interoperability adapters to established scientific and commercial tools and services; 3) Data linkage as precisely versioned, lightweight dependencies; And 4) actionable process provenance capture for arbitrary command execution that affords automatic re-execution.

\subsection{Technical features}

Fundamental to DataLad's functionality is the concept of the ``DataLad dataset'', DataLad's central data structure.
On a technical level, it is a joint Git and git-annex repository with additional metadata and features for scientific use cases added on top by DataLad.\\
Git excels at managing and collaborating on text files, and provides a powerful back bone to DataLad's features.
Git repositories can be easily distributed as linked \textit{clones} to suitable infrastructure to share files and their revision history.
Locally, changes to files can be saved (\textit{committed}) with detailed provenance and transferred (\textit{pushed}) to all clones of a repository, and remote revisions can be retrieved and integrated (\textit{pulled}).\\
However, Git is not designed to handle large or binary files as common in science.
Git-annex overcomes this limitation and adds support to track and transfer files of arbitrary size or type without placing their content into Git.
Instead, it places file content into a managed repository \textit{annex} and only commits a lightweight reference that encodes the file's name and content identity via content hash into Git.
This reference allows a decoupling of file content (handled by git-annex) and file name (tracked with Git), but retains the ability to transparently notice and track changes: If file content changes, the identity reference known to Git changes, too, and the version control system becomes aware of the modification.
The same mechanism guarantees file integrity at all times and solves data privacy concerns without impacting discoverability, as potentially sensitive content can be kept private but its metadata can be distributed easily.
While Git keeps a reference of the content \textit{identity}, git-annex tracks content \textit{availability}, and manages data transport with an extensible set of protocols and set of hosting solutions to and from a local repository annex at a granularity of individual files. \\
DataLad, finally, extends Git and git-annex with easy to use modularization, re-executable annotation of changes, and targeted interfaces and interoperability adapters.\\
Modularization facilitates reusability in research workflows.
Scientific projects can encompass a large amount of files, or have a heterogeneous nature, comprising different data sources or evolving data across different processing stages.
Organizing them into a modular structure of homogeneous or smaller components enables more efficient reuse.
DataLad allows to nest individual datasets via versioned linkage as lightweight dependencies, and provides seamless recursive operations across dataset boundaries by extending Gitâs submodule mechanism.
With this, DataLad provides a ``monorepo''-like user experience in datasets with arbitrarily deep nesting, and makes it trivial to operate on individual files deep in the hierarchy or entire trees of datasets, while individual datasets can easily be reused in new contexts (see \cref{fig:subdslinkage}).\\
Re-executable annotations of changes constitute process provenance.
In DataLad datasets, DataLad can wrap any command execution and automatically capture the command, the generated outputs or modification, and optionally all required input elements with a so-called \texttt{datalad run} or a \texttt{datalad containers-run} command.
The former command captures the execution of any shell command, and the latter command can use software containers, tracked in DataLad datasets, for executing commands inside a specific software environment or containerized pipeline.
Both commands retrieve inputs, initiate command execution, and, if it succeeds, save results together with a re-executable provenance in a structured annotation to a Git commit message (see)\cref{fig:fairly_metadata}).
In addition to providing reliable information about past command-line invocations, these machine-readable records make it possible to easily re-execute commands, for example to verify if a result is computationally reproducible or to apply an analog change to a different dataset state.\\
Interoperability adapters, finally, streamline data publication and consumption routines.
Being able to efficiently retrieve and update research objects across a variety of available storage options is an important part of \gls{rdm} \citep{borghi2018data}.
Git can already interact with other local or remote repositories via standard or custom network transport protocols, and git-annex readily provides access to a wide range of external data storage resources via a large set of protocols.
On top of this, DataLad implements support for additional services that require custom protocols, such as the \gls{osf} \citep{hanke2021dlosf} or XNAT \citep[\url{www.xnat.org},][]{halchenko2021xnat}, and can add more fine-grained access (e.g. direct access to individual components contained in an archive hosted on cloud storage).
With this approach, DataLad can help to overcome technological limitations of storage solutions, or integrate seamlessly with technology that is already in use.

	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{linkage_subds.png}
	\caption[DataLad dataset linkage]{Exemplary dataset hierarchy in a research project. DataLad datasets can be linked as actionable superdataset-subdataset relationsships. This allows, for example, to add a DataLad dataset with preprocessed data in a dependency-like link to an analysis. As DataLad datasets decouple sizable file content from file availability metadata, such links are only a fraction of the size of the data they track. At the same time, linkage is seamless, and DataLad operations can work across dataset boundaries. This feature enables modular projects from stand-alone units that facilitate reuse.}
	\label{fig:subdslinkage}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Development principles}

DataLad's development is guided by four principles \citep{Halchenko2021}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The only two recognized entities are Datasets and the files they comprise,
	\item A dataset is a Git repository with an optional annex,
	\item The should be as few custom procedures and data structures as possible,
	\item Complete decentralization, with no required central server or service, but maximum interoperability with existing 3rd-party resources and infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

These principles ensure DataLad's open and domain agnostic nature, maximize the long-term utility of DataLad datasets, minimize users' technical debt and reduce the risk of adoption.
When using DataLad datasets for digital objects, access to any resource managed with DataLad has no critical dependency on service deployments governed by central entities, and even on DataLad itself.
A further characteristic is that DataLad is developed not as a singular tool, but as an extensible ecosystem of software packages.
A core package provides basic functionality, and DataLad extensions, stand-alone Python packages with additional DataLad functionality, can enhance it with domain-focused or technology-specific features.
This aims to keep the source code maintainable, and allows users to tune the command-suite to their specific needs.


\subsection{User experience}

On the conceptual level, a DataLad dataset is an overlay structure to version control files of any size, track and publish files in a distributed fashion, and record, publish, and execute actionable provenance of files and file
transformations.
On a file system, it appears like a regular directory.
Users can either create DataLad datasets from scratch (\texttt{datalad create}) or install them from a variety of sources (\texttt{datalad clone}).
When consuming DataLad datasets from external sources, annexed file content can be retrieved (\texttt{datalad get}) and removed (\texttt{datalad drop}) on demand if the given user has potentially necessary access rights.
Generally, DataLad's commands aim to simplify standard workflows from Git, git-annex, or hosting services to make them more accessible to technical novices.
For example, committing a file into Git requires a \texttt{git add} followed by a \texttt{git commit}, and annexing a file requires a \texttt{git annex add} followed by a \texttt{git commit}.
A \texttt{datalad save}, on the other hand, performs either action, with automatic decision making whether the file is annexed or committed to Git.
Likewise, publishing a repository to hosting sites usually requires interactions in the hosting site's web interface, but DataLad provides a set of \texttt{create-sibling-<service>} commands that spare users the need to visit the hosting service.
And publication dependencies or automatic configurations can publish Git revision history and annexed file contents conjunctly, using \texttt{datalad push}.
Provenance capture can be achieved by wrapping command executions in either a \texttt{datalad run} or \texttt{datalad containers-run}\footnote{The \texttt{datalad containers-run} command is provided by the \texttt{datalad-container} extension package, available with standard Python package managers.} command, and they can be re-executed using \texttt{datalad rerun} (see \cref{fig:fairly_metadata}).
When working in hierarchies of datasets, any command's \texttt{--recursive} parameter applies it to downstream datasets.
Despite the fact that DataLad provides its own set of commands, compatibility with all Git and git-annex functionality is retained, and users are free to chose their workflows.
Like Git and git-annex, DataLad is primarily developed as a command line tool, but a \gls{gui} exists as well (see \cref{fig:gooey}).\\
With DataLad's streamlined data transport routines, users cab utilize web sources, including major cloud storage providers, paths on local or remote computational infrastructure, or neuroscientific data registries such as OpenNeuro \citep{markiewicz2021openneuro} for file storage or collaboration.
At the same time, the separation of file content and file name makes a lean, meta-data based representation independent from actual data retrieval.
Thus, datasets of arbitrary scale can be cloned, exposing file names and revision history of all contained files, and provide actionable access to its content at a fraction of their total size.
And in order to expose datasets for easier access, users can publish DataLad datasets to common repository hosting infrastructure as access points to install data, without actually publishing data contents to these services.
These features aid with \gls{rdm} tasks in scientific projects.
A thorough overview of them can be found in the software's documentation, which is elaborated on in chapter \ref{chap:k2}, and a comprehensive use case is detailed in chapter \ref{chap:k3}.

A file tree (left) provides an overview of the file system, and annotates elements into DataLad datasets, contents tracked with Git or git-annex, untracked, modified, or clean states. A command window (right) as well as right-click drop down menus (not shown) lets users parametrize and execute DataLad commands. A log window (bottom) can display result outcomes, error, or help text.}

\subsection{Software adoption and relevance}

As DataLad does not employ tracking code, the exact number of its users is not known.
However, download statistics from the major Python package managers \texttt{pip} and \texttt{conda}, and popularity statistics from users of the Debian operating system can provide rough references.
According to \url{pypistats.org}, the main DataLad Python package was downloaded from the Python Package Index 300 times per day on average in May 2023.
The Python distribution Anaconda (\url{anaconda.org}) counts a total of 333932 downloads of the software throughout versions 0.9.3 (April 2018) and 0.18.3 (May 2023), averaging 180 downloads per day.
The \texttt{popularity-contest} software is a Debian package that, if installed on a users system, reports anonymous statistics about most-used Debian packages.
This data is aggregated into a popularity contest.
According to it, in May 2023 between 0.08 and 0.1 percent of systems reporting statistics have a DataLad installation (see \cref{fig:popcon}).
All of these sources contain biases that limit conclusion to the number of users, though.
Installations via Python package managers are commonly performed by individual end users, whereas installations of Debian packages can correspond to system-wide installations on multi-user systems such as high performance computing infrastructure.
Likewise, upgrades of existing installations to more recent versions are included in these data, as well as temporary installations of the software in automated continuous integration test suites.
Nevertheless, download statistics attest that it is an actively used tool with a user base that exceeds the circle of its developers by far.
The citation count of the academic paper, totaling 53 in May 2023, 1.5 years after its publication by \citet{Halchenko2021}, and active contributor community around the source repository on GitHub, currently amounting to 48 individuals with committed code contributions, confirms that.
DataLad's current popularity, however, has not been established from the beginning of its development.
The next chapter will highlight how scientific software like DataLad can be improved and gain popularity, and, vice versa improve scientific practice.
