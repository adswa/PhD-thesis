The original publications from \citep{Halchenko2021} and \citep{wagner2022fairly} are included hereafter.
As the publication belonging to \citep{wagner2020datalad} is a book, it is included as a physical copy.
My contributions to these works are as follows:

For \citet{wagner2020datalad}, I conceived the conceptual structure and educational concept, co-created the technical backbone, coordinated development efforts and community management, and wrote most of its contents.\\
For \citet{Halchenko2021}, I contributed to the conceptualization, writing, and editing of the manuscript, and have been a regular contributor to the underlying software since 2019.\\
For \citet{wagner2022fairly}, I co-conceived the setup of the framework, co-piloted and documented an earlier version of the framework with a smaller dataset, co-implemented the open workflow, wrote the first draft of the manual, and contributed to the conceptualization, writing, and editing of the manuscript.
